    "In a world which survives on food, water, oxygen and text messages; we notice that people often don't bother much about punctuation and grammar in their text messages. This is somewhat understandable, partly because every extra keystroke on a miniature keypad takes a lot more work than it would take on a laptop or a desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to build a small sub-feature of a punctuation corrector which can handle one small but specific, and frequent issue: detecting (and correcting) whether the appropriate form of the word ought to be \"its\" or \"it's\" - a common point of confusion in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's is the contraction of \"it is\" and \"it has.\"  \n",
    "Its is a possessive form - i.e., it shows ownership.  \n",
    "You are given sentences which contain one or more occurrences of either 'its' or 'it's'. These occurrences have been replaced by three question marks (???). Display with correct form of the sentence, with the question marks replaced by either 'it's' or 'its', as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "The first line contains an integer N, 1<=N<=200.\n",
    "This is followed by N lines, each containing 1 sentence, with not more than a total of 300 characters. The occurrences of 'it's' and 'its' have been replaced by '???\" in these sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format\n",
    "N lines, each containing one sentence. The ith output contains the completed version of the ith input, where the '???' have been replaced by either 'it's' or 'its', as appropriate.\n",
    "Capitalization will be ignored.\n",

    "Sample Input\n",
