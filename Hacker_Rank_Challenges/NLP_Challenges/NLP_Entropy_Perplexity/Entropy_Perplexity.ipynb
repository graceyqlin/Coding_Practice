    "In information theory, perplexity is a measurement of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. It may be used to compare probability models. A low perplexity indicates the probability distribution is good at predicting the sample.\n",

    "PP is an intrinsic evaluation. It's a bad approximation unless the test data is very similar to training data. Only useful in pilot experiments. But it's helpful to think about. "
